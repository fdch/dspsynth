<p>Times: Tues 18-20:30</p>
<p>Location: Studio</p>
<p>Instructor: Fede Camara Halac</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the course <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a></p>
<p>In this class we will go through computer music synthesis essentials
for music production and sound art. As composers, performers, or
educators you will learn how to use audio and control signals, which are
the base of interdiciplinary and collaborative art. We will also use
this class to learn the basics of <a href="http://puredata.info">Pure
Data (Pd)</a>.</p>
<p>If you have quesions about those things, send me an email (see
below).</p>
<p>We will <em>not see any code</em> because Pd is a graphic programming
environment, but we will go through some basic programming principles.
You don't need to have previous experience with Pd or other programming
languages. If you do have a experience with these languages, then the
class should be informative because of the specific tools and techniques
we will be covering. Plus there's all that music stuff we do. During the
term, if you are having serious problems, please come to talk to me so
that I can work with you or adjust the syllabus to get things back
on-track.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective is to create a digital musical instrument
based on a design taken from an analog synthesizer such as: MiniMoog,
Apollo1, Volca Bass, etc.</p>

<h1 id="structure">Structure</h1>
<p>Class meets on Tuesdays in <strong>Studio</strong> from 18:00 to
about 20/20:30 or so.</p>
<p>We may make a few assignments throughout the term, mainly to spur
class discussion. Hopefully some of the assignments may lead to your
final projects for the class.</p>
<p>Here is a link to download the software that we may be using in
class:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html.">puredata</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We will have several guest speakers in the class during the term.
Watch for announcements on the <a href="syllabus.html">course
syllabus</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="facilities">Facilities</h1>
<p>Nearly all of the Studio space and hardware resources are available
for you to use. If you prefer to work on your own computer, that's
perfectly fine. Otherwise you may sign up studios and machines for doing
your work at the Studio using our <a href="index.html">on-line signup
system</a>. If you are having trouble getting access to the hardware or
software you need, please let us know.</p>
<div class="line-block">Again, please let us know if you are having
problems getting equipment or software to work for you. In general, if
you are having difficulty understanding the programming paradigms we are
using or the applications and information we are covering. be sure to
talk to us. We'll be happy to sit down and work through any issues with
you.</div>
<hr />
<h1 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h1>
<p>The course syllabus is located <a href="syllabus.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will put each class on its own website every week and link to it
on the main syllabus page. We'll try to keep up with linking in class
patches, examples and information, but we may fall behind. Please let us
know when we do.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h1>
<p>The best way to reach us is through e-mail: camarafede at gmail dot
com</p>
<p>I will be holding office hours from 2-6 on Tuesdays, 9-12.30 Wed and
Thursdays. I will also usually be around before or after class, in
addition to being around the Studio on various days. If it looks like we
need to schedule some more formal sessions for additional info, we
will.</p>
<p>It's always a good idea to make an appointment to see me, even during
my purported office hours, because I often have to run around campus
like a maniac doing strange, computer-music stuff.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="grades">Grades</h1>
<p>Grades will be based mainly on the final projects you do. We will
discuss projects as the semester progresses. As noted above, we may be
making some assignments throughout the term and discussing these in
class. It'a always fun to see what you all can do.</p>
<p>I believe at this point in your career the last thing you should be
worrying about is a grade. The main thing is to find something that
you'd really like to do and then do it.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the class!</p>
