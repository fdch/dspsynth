In this class we introduce the structure of the class, and our beloved `Pure Data (Pd) <http://puredata.info>`__. 

The topics of this week's class are:
    - Intro to the class. 
    - Installing, configuring Pd. 
    - Making and saving a patch. 
    - The 5 objects in pd: object, message, number, symbol, comment.
    - The sinusoid.
    - Order of execution. Hot and Cold inlets.
    - Simple math exercises.
    
After the class you will have some exercises and a better idea of the following Pd objects:
    - ``unpack``,
    - ``trigger``,
    - ``+``,
    - ``-``,
    - ``*``,
    - ``/``,
    - ``print``
