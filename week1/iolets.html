<h1 id="outlets-and-inlets">Outlets and Inlets</h1>
<p>A Pd object is displayed on screen as a box that can generally be
connected to other boxes.</p>
<p><img src="../images/iolets.png" width="400" alt="image" /></p>
<p>These <strong>connections</strong> can be made by hovering with the
mouse pointer over the <strong>outlet</strong> (thicker line at the
bottom of an object), to the <strong>inlet</strong> (thicker line at the
top of an object) of another object.</p>
<p><img src="../images/connecting.gif" width="300" alt="image" /></p>
<h1 id="hot-and-cold-inlets">Hot and Cold inlets</h1>
<p>The left-most inlet is known as the <strong>hot inlet</strong>
because whenever it receives a message this causes the object to emit
some output to its outlets.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>print</code> object, which has one outlet,
the message is immediately sent to (and therefore printed on) the Pd
console.</p>
<p><img src="../images/helloworld.png" width="700" alt="image" /></p>
<p>However, certain objects have multiple inlets. In these cases, the
first inlet keeps the same function as above, and the rest will generaly
not cause the object to output anything. Instead they usually update
internal variables of the object. This is why the rest of the inlets are
called <strong>cold inlets</strong>.</p>
<p>A group of objects that show this behavior is the <code>binary</code>
operators for math operations like: <code>+, -, *, /</code></p>
<p><img src="../images/hotcold.png" width="300" alt="image" /></p>
<dl class="incremental">
<dt>As such, when you change the right-most number box which is
connected to the cold inlet, nothing happens visually. But, when you
change the left-most number box connected to the hot inlet, a number is
displayed on the bottom number box.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Precisely, the number output is the result of adding the left-most
number to the most recent right-most number, ie. the number stored in
the cold inlet.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="order-of-execution">Order of Execution</h1>
<p>One thing that is important to know is the order in which Pd objects
process their outputs. Again, objects with one output are not an issue
because the message is sent to the object's only output like the
<code>+</code> object. There are objects with multiple outlets.</p>
<p>The way Pd outputs its messages to multiple outputs is from
<strong>right to left.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../images/order.png" width="300" alt="image" /></p>
<dl class="incremental">
<dt><code>unpack</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>unpack</code> object takes a <strong>list</strong> of
messages as input and distributes them in order to every outlet, so that
the first element of the list correspond to the first outlet, the second
of the list to the second outlet, etc. The output occurs as always
<strong>from right to left</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is why, in the image above the first <code>-</code> object
computes the substraction <code>5 - 3</code> correctly, ie
<code>2</code>, while the second group does not. The output of the
second group is <code>3</code>, which is the result of adding
<code>3</code> to <code>0</code> which is the initial value of the
<code>-</code> object, triggered first because it is connected to the
right-most outlet of the <code>unpack</code>. After outputting the
result, the value <code>5</code> is sent to the <strong>cold
inlet</strong> of the <code>-</code> object.</p>
<p>As you can tell, it is <em>very important</em> to keep in mind the
order of execution when working with Pd objects.</p>
