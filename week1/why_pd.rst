- You can learn from the source code
- It has few visual elements
- It's written in C (it's small, it's light and it's lightning fast)
- Pd has a GUI that runs in its own dedicated process
- It has version compatibility (patches from 1997 are still supported...)
- You have support of a very generous online community:
